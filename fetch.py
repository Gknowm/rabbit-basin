"""
Fills in everything the Oregon map needs. Run it once:

    python3 fetch.py

Two layers only, statewide:

  1. Gem and rockhounding occurrences from DOGAMI MILO, whole state.
  2. BLM mining claims, but ONLY the ones within 5 km of one of those
     occurrences. Statewide claims would be 10-30 MB and most of it is
     gold country you have no reason to look at. This keeps the file
     small and keeps every claim that could actually matter to you.

To check the sources are alive without downloading anything:

    python3 fetch.py --check

To add gold claims and mines later, set GOLD = True below and run it
again. The map already knows how to draw them.

Needs Python 3.8 or newer. No extra packages.
